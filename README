This is simply my set of config files for the Sublime Text 2 text editor, which is quickly becoming my tool of choice. Having this up as a GitHub repo is just to make it easier to sync settings between my OS X, Linux, and Windows boxes, but feel free to fork this project if you find it useful for some reason!
